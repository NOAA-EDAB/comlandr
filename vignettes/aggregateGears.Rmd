Specifying the arguments `aggGear = T` (in `get_comland_data()`) and supplying a data frame, `userGears`, fishing fleets are returned by aggregating the landings over gear types.
  * `NEGEAR2` gear codes are aggregated to fleets as defined in `userGears`
  
For a list of `NEGEAR2` codes see `get_gears()`
