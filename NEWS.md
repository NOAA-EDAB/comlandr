# comlandr 1.1.0

Previous version of package pulled from a deprecated time series. It was then hard coded in the package as a lazyloaded dataset, with a manual updating process.
This has been replaced with a workflow to pull the data stream via API. To ensure even if API fails there is economic data available

## Minor changes

* Use the Federal reserve bank of st louis price deflator. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU0223. This is a monthly index. 
* `adjust_inflation.r` edited to use this data stream. 
* Add argument checks in `check_argument_validation.r` to throw an error if reference values for Month and/or Year fall outside the data set.
* Workflow (`getFred.yaml`) sends email every month to report if the economic data has changed, runs on a schedule 20th of the month since data is updated on 16th of month
  * compares data in repo and new pulled data (`compare_fred_data` & `get_fred`)
  * sends email report (`sendAsEmail.rmd`)
* Add rmd to document schemas used

## Bug fixes

* Many of the data tables used in the supporting functions have been moved from NEFSC to GARFO (Schema changes).
Changes to reflect this have been made in several of the `get` functions 
* `refYear` and `refMonth` allowed to both be `NA` or both not `NA` PR
* Can not have either `refYear` and `refMonth` to be `NA`  if other is not.
* A change in `data.table` resulted in a string names to be converted to a vector for use in join statements.

## New functions

* `get_species_stock_area.r` - Extrats statistical areas that comprise species stock definition


# comlandr 1.0.0

A significant overhaul to the layout and structure of the package.
Many changes are internal and will not be apparent to a user

## Major changes

* Reworked algorithm to assign unknowns. This operation now takes place immediately following data pull
* Changed names and reorganzied many internal functions
* Added functions to estimate discards
* Added lazy loaded datasets from mskeyrun project and price data
* Switched underlying data source. From WODETS, WOLANDS, CFDETS to STOCKEFF (which pulls from these earlier data sources along with CAMS)
